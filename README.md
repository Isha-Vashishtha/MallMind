# MallMind
An AI-powered AR shopping companion for malls that brings e-commerce–level personalization to physical retail. The PWA uses a swarm of intelligent agents to analyze user intent, check real-time store inventory, trigger dynamic discounts, and guide shoppers through the most efficient in-mall route—complete with indoor navigation and virtual try-ons.

##📌 Overview

With the rise of platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, physical malls struggle with personalization and digital intelligence. Shoppers often feel overwhelmed by numerous stores and lack real-time information on inventory, discounts, and navigation.
