### Hyper-Personalized Agentic Shopping Concierge for Smart Malls

Mall-Mind is a mobile-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to transform traditional mall experiences using Agentic AI.  
It brings e-commerce–level personalization, intelligence, and automation into physical retail environments.

The system uses multiple intelligent agents to understand user intent, check simulated real-time inventory, generate optimized indoor routes, and provide dynamic shopping assistance — all without requiring app installation.

## 📖 Overview

With the rapid growth of platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, physical malls struggle with personalization and digital intelligence. Shoppers often feel overwhelmed by numerous stores and lack real-time visibility into inventory, discounts, and navigation.

Mall-Mind bridges this gap by combining AI-driven personalization with real-world shopping experiences.
